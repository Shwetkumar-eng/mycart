USES of Arnica montana(Arnica)

     
      Arnica (Arnica montana) has been used for medicinal purposes since the 1500s and is still popular today.
     
      Applied to the skin as a cream, ointment, liniment, salve, or tincture, arnica has been used to soothe muscle aches,

      reduce inflammation, and heal wounds.


ADVANTAGE


    Arnica is used topically for a wide range of conditions, including bruises,

    sprains, muscle aches, wound healing, superficial phlebitis, joint pain,
  
    inflammation from insect bites, and swelling from broken bones. More recent

    studies suggest it may also be helpful in the treatment of burns.


DISADVANTAGE


   Taking arnica in amounts more than what is found in food is likely unsafe.

   In fact, arnica is considered poisonous. When taken by mouth it can cause vomiting,

   heart damage, organ failure, increased bleeding, coma, and death.
