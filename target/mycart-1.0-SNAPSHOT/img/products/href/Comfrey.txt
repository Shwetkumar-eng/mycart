Symphytum officinale (Comfrey)
	
	Symphytum officinale is a perennial flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae
 	Along with thirty four other species of Symphytum
	it is known as comfrey. To differentiate it from other members of the genus Symphytum
	this species is known as common comfrey[1] or true comfrey.

Uses of Comfrey :-
	
	Comfrey (Symphytum officinale) is a plant with yellow or purple flowers that has been used as a medicinal herb for centuries.
	It contains chemicals called allantoin and rosmarinic acid that may have health benefits
	but it also contains poisonous chemicals that can cause severe liver damage.

Advantage :-
	
	Allantoin: Boosts the growth of new skin cells and speeds up tissue growth
	Rosmarinic acid: Relieves pain and inflammation
	Mucilage: A major constituent of the comfrey plant
	
	
Disadvantage :-

	Comfrey is mildly toxic. Like most Boraginaceae, 
	it contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are toxic compounds readily absorbed via the stomach or skin, 
	and have potential to increase the risk of fatal liver toxicity.
